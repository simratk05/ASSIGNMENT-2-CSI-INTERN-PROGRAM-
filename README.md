# ASSIGNMENT-2-CSI-INTERN-PROGRAM

In this assignment we were given to create a Python program that implements a singly linked list using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.A Node class to represent each node in the list. A LinkedList class to manage the nodes, with methods to: Add a node to the end of the list Print the list Delete the nth node (where n is a 1-based index) Include exception handling to manage edge cases such as: Deleting a node from an empty list Deleting a node with an index out of range Test your implementation with at least one sample list.
